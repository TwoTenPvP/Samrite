## Samrite
Samrite is a work-in-progress security service for Windows computers (mostly targeted at Laptops, but can be used on any Windows device).

It allows you to (hopefully) recover devices that have been stolen or lost. Some features include:
* Locatation based on Wi-Fi triangulation
* Remote webcam snapshots
* Remote desktop snapshots

And more to come.
